        <h2>About the song</h2>
        <p><strong>"Birds of a Feather"</strong> by <strong>Billie Eilish</strong> and Finneas is a hauntingly beautiful song about intense, unconditional love and emotional dependency. The lyrics depict a relationship so deep that the narrator feels they are inseparable from their partner, even to the point of death. The recurring line "Birds of a feather, we should stick together" symbolizes the bond between the two, much like how birds of the same kind naturally stick together inseparable and perfectly matched.</p>

        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>I want you to stay
            'Til I'm in the grave
            'Til I rot away, dead and buried
            'Til I'm in the casket you carry
            If you go, I'm going too, uh
            'Cause it was always you, alright
            And if I'm turning blue, please don't save me
            Nothing left to lose without my baby
            Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know
            I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
            Can't change the weather, might not be forever
            But if it's forever, it's even better
            And I don't know what I'm crying for
            I don't think I could love you more
            It might not be long, but baby, I
            I'll love you 'til the day that I die
            'Til the day that I die
            'Til the light leaves my eyes
            'Til the day that I die
            I want you to see, hm
            How you look to me, hm
            You wouldn't believe if I told ya
            You would keep the compliments I throw ya
            But you're so full of shit, uh
            Tell me it's a bit, oh
            Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
            Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid
            And I don't know what I'm crying for
            I don't think I could love you more
            Might not be long, but baby, I
            Don't wanna say goodbye
            Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('til the day that I die)
            I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('til the light leaves my eyes)
            Can't change the weather, might not be forever ('til the day that I die)
            But if it's forever, it's even better
            I knew you in another life
            You had that same look in your eyes
            I love you, don't act so surprised</p>
